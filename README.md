# iPlayer-Downloader-Assistant
A simple command line assistant for use with get_iplayer

This Python scripts automates a few of the most commonly entered commands with get_iplayer and means less typing for you when downloading many shows.

It does require get_iplayer to be installed already:

This script is not affiliated with get_iplayer and is just a personal project for my use, but feel free to copy and/or take snippets for your own projects.
